**WRF-STILT tutorial**<br> 

If you are reading this tutorial you are likely interested in running HYSPLIT-STILT with model output from the Weather Research and Forecast model (Skamarock et al. 2008). First, why *WRF-STILT*?

1) While there are a number of meteorological input files out there, many of these analyses have either limited domains and/or spatial resolution. Coarse spatial resolution can limit the ability for STILT to accurately trace air flow in areas with complex terrain and/or fine-scale meteorological circulations. WRF offers a way to downscale coarser-scale meteorological analyses to resolutions needed to resolve smaller-scale phenomena.
